# AWS S3 Data Exporter for Prometheus

This Python script fetches AWS billing data from an S3 bucket, processes the data, and then exposes relevant billing metrics via Prometheus.

## ðŸš€ Features

- S3 File Download: Downloads the most recent file from an S3 bucket.
- CSV Extraction: Extracts metrics from a CSV file that is zipped.
- Prometheus Metrics Exposure: Exposes metrics such as usage_quantity, blended_cost, and unblended_cost per AWS product to Prometheus.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Python: Version 3.11.4
Python Libraries: Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- boto3 (Version 1.24.28)
- pandas (Version 2.1.0)
- prometheus_client (Version 0.17.1)
- python-dotenv (Version 1.0.0)

## ðŸ”§ Setup

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Marta-Barea/prometheus-aws-billing-exporter

```

3. Environment Configuration:

Set up your AWS credentials and the desired S3 bucket name in a .env file.

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY
S3_BUCKET_NAME=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

## ðŸš€ Running the Script
